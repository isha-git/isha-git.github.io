      Thank you for taking an interest in my profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Welcome to my webpage! My journey began during my undergraduate studies, where I became fascinated with neural networks and their potential.
      Since then, I have worked on several projects and research internships, including stock data forecasting, pollution estimation, and disease susceptibility prediction.
      My undergraduate thesis focused on developing image denoising techniques using a shallow convolutional neural network, which outperformed state-of-the-art algorithms by identifying regions of the input image that suggested noise.

      I worked as an AI Research Engineer for Splink Inc., a Japanese start-up, on Alzheimer's Disease prediction using neuroimages.
      Recently, I completed my Master's in computer science with Artificial Intelligence track at Delft University of Technology.
      For my graduate thesis, I analyzed millions of microbiome DNA sequences and studied their association with colorectal cancer and type-2 diabetes using self-supervised learning.

      My passion for data analysis extends beyond specific projects or research topics.
      I believe in understanding the "why" behind machine learning models' predictions, emphasizing feature importance and model interpretability.
      I am actively seeking new opportunities in machine learning and am excited to continue exploring the vast potential of this exciting field.
